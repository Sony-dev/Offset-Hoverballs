Hoverballs that smoothly follow the terrain underneath them. Perfect for building hover vehicles of all kinds.\
See the [Steam Workshop page][ref-workshop] for more information and some very compressed gifs.

## How to install:
Drop the `offset_hoverballs` folder into your `GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/` directory and you're done.

## Want to help translate this addon?
Excellent! Please grab a copy of the `en` language folder from `main/resource/localization/` \
and rename it to the short code of the language you're translating into.\
(So `fr` for French, `de` for German, `ru` for Russian, etc.)\
[See this page for the code list gmod supports][ref-trans].

Inside the folder is the `offset_hoverball.properties` file where you can add your translated strings.\
Please try to follow the same layout and naming scheme as the other properties files.

Once you're done just submit your file as a pull request on this page and wait for approval.\
Your help in making our little addon more accessible is very much appreciated. Thank you!
